# Embedded Book Club - Finland

We're knowledge sharing enthusiasts, focused on hosting in-person events, to bond over technical topics related to embedded systems.

Our main focus is to treat this group as a book club, where we select a book or online reference to dissect. We meet periodically as we cover each chapter of the book, and in some cases, the topics can translate into hackaton-type events, where we work on a particular project.

One of my goals is to create a tight knowledge sharing community in Finland, that focuses on topics from the basics to future trends.
